            The BubbleSwap protocol enables users to maximize their profits by
            staking their liquidity provider (LP) tokens and earning synthetic
            yield rewards.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm">
            These rewards are determined by a liquidity provider tax, but are
            significantly increased when users lock their tokens for a specific
            duration. With this innovative form of yield farming, users can
            amplify their earnings while investing a smaller portion of their
            capital.
